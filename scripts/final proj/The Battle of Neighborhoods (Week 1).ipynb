    "As someone who is lives in Greater Boston and works in downtown area, I am often asked for recommendations, things to do, and areas to live from friends, colleagues who either live in different US cities or who are travelling to Boston on a work/pleasure trip. A systematic analysis of neighbored and venues not only benefit them but it will be beneficial for me as well at a personal level to explore areas and places which I have not explored.\n",
